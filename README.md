Lesson 1:

The first lesson explained how LangGraph enables developers to combine reliable control flows with LLM-based decision-making to build adaptive AI agents. 
It covers the foundations, memory, human oversight, and customization of these agents. It basically explained how LangGraph lessens the degradation of reliability on increasing agent's level of control. It then further explained the future modules.

Lesson 2: 

We learned how to make simple graphs, it was taught how to add nodes, edges and conditional edges and how to build the entire graphs.

 Code edit: I added another node, node4 and then connected that to the conditional edge, I used the path_map in this which allows us to properly connect more than 2 nodes.
